## üè¶ Banking Deposit Classification

### üìå Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various banking campaign and client demographic data. The goal is to assist banking institutions in identifying potential customers for targeted marketing efforts, thereby optimizing campaign effectiveness and increasing deposit subscriptions.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Highlights

  * **Dataset**: [Kaggle - Banking Dataset Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashmiranu/banking-dataset-classification)
  * **Size**: 5000 entries (after trimming for analysis), 16 columns
  * **Key Features**:
      * age, job, marital, education, default, housing, loan, contact, month, day\_of\_week, duration, campaign, pdays, previous, poutcome
  * **Approach**:
      * Data Loading and Concatenation of train and test datasets.
      * Exploratory Data Analysis (checking `shape`, `size`, `info`, `describe`, `isnull().sum()`, `duplicated().sum()`, `nunique()`, `value_counts()` for target).
      * Label Encoding for all categorical features.
      * Handling Class Imbalance with `SMOTE` (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) on the training data.
      * Binary Classification (Term Deposit Subscription: `yes` (1), No Subscription: `no` (0)).
      * Models Used:
          * Logistic Regression, Ridge Classifier, SVC, Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Bagging, Decision Tree

### üéØ Purpose and Applications

  * Enable banks to **target potential customers** more effectively for term deposit campaigns.
  * Optimize marketing spend by focusing on individuals with a higher likelihood of conversion.
  * Improve customer relationship management by understanding client behavior and preferences.
  * Support data-driven decision-making in banking product offerings and outreach strategies.

### ü§ù Collaboration

We welcome contributions to improve the project. You can help by:

  * Improving model robustness and generalization through advanced hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques.
  * Exploring feature engineering to create more insightful variables from existing data.
  * Conducting more in-depth analysis of class imbalance handling methods.
  * Deploying the model as an API for real-time prediction in banking systems.
